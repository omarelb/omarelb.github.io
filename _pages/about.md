Hi there! First off, thanks for visiting my blog! In this blog, I hope to share exciting things on **Artificial Intelligence** that I find interesting! My goal is to enhance my own and others' understanding on all kinds of topics. Please [contact](/contact/) me if you have any questions or suggestions!

# Me

My name's Omar Elbaghdadi. This year (2018), I finished by bachelor's degree in *Econometrics and Operations Research*, and I would like to do my master's in AI starting next year. My other interests include dancing, music, and traveling! Right now I'm saving up to go on a trip through South America.
