Hi there! First off, thanks for visiting my blog! In this blog, I hope to share exciting things on **Artificial Intelligence** that I find interesting! My goal is to enhance my own and others' understanding on all kinds of topics. Please [contact](mailto:omarelblog@gmail.com) me if you have any questions or suggestions!

# Me

My name's Omar Elbaghdadi. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the University of Amsterdam. I have a background in *Econometrics and Operations Research*, which I have a bachelor's degree in.

My main interest of subjects within AI are Bayesian methods and Reinforcement Learning. I'm just starting out blogging, but I'd like to write more about these topics.

Besides AI, I'm passionate about dancing salsa, music, cooking, and traveling! I have lived in Beijing for half a year and have also backpacked through South America!
