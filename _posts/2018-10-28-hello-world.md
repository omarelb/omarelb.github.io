Hi there! This is my first blog post ever! I want to start writing about topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

I got inspired to start blogging by several other bloggers, including [Rachel Thomas](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045), [Jason Brownlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com/about/), and [Rohan and Lenny](https://ayearofai.com/0-2016-is-the-year-i-venture-into-artificial-intelligence-d702d65eb919). The key reasons for doing this are:

- Building up a portfolio,
- helping understand stuff.

As of around a year ago, I began to grow increasingly interested in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science. So much so, that I decided I want to apply for a master's degree in the subject. My background in Econometrics and Operations Research has given me a solid base in statistical modelling and optimization, which I believe is of core importance to many applications in AI.

There are still way too many subjects, however, that I don't know too much about. By writing about them and explaining concepts as simply as I possibly can, I hope to really deepen my knowledge on subjects, improve my technical writing and help make things clear for others at the same time.

I want to make learning about Artificial Intelligence a project, a journey. There are so many exciting advances in the field, so there is a lot to catch up with. Real world applications are becoming increasingly widespread as well, even hitting headlines regularly, making it a science that's interesting even at parties. I guess it's the perfect subject for the phrase: *"Let's make nerds cool again."*

This post is the start of a journey for me, let's make it an interesting ride! Also, I love meeting new people, so don't hesitate to contact me!
